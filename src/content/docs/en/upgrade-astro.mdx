## Semantic versioning

Astro attempts to adhere as much as possible to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). In this section, you'll find more
information of what you should expect when upgrading Astro and .

### Patch changes

- Re-releases after a failed release.
- Internal changes that don’t change Astro’s functionality:
  - refactors
  - performance improvements
  - increase or change in test coverage
- Improvements or fixes on logs and errors.
- Fixes to Astro logic that violates the documentation.
- Fixes to Astro logic, even for cases where users were taking advantage of that bug.
- Fixes to bugs that caused regressions to some documented behaviours.

### Minor changes

- **Deprecations** of existing features/options.
- Introduction of new functionalities.
- Upgrade of minimal required Node.js version (minor or patch), e.g. from `v18.4.0` to `v18.7.0`.
  :::note
  We take these kind of changes very seriously, and approve them only if we think that a new version of Node.js can improve the DX of our users, and impact core functionalities.
  :::
- Introduction of new options in the integration hooks.
- Introduction of new functionalities in `astro/app`, notably used for creating new adapters.

### Major changes

- Upgrade of minimal required Node.js version (minor or major), e.g. from `v18.4.0` to `v20.0.0`.
- Removal of deprecated functionalities.
- Changes of existing functionalities.
- Changes of existing options in the integration hooks.
- Changes of existing options and functionalities in `astro/app`, notably used for creating new adapters.

### Exceptions and deprecations

- **Experimental features** are **exempt** from semantic versioning. Those features are usually a result of an ongoing RFC stage 3, and their behaviour can break in minor and patch changes.

  Once these features are out of their experimentation period, they will follow the normal semantic versioning contract.

- Improvements to the documentation. These changes are automatically pulled from the `docs` project.
