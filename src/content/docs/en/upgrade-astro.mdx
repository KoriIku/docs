## Semantic versioning

Astro attempts to adhere as much as possible to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), which is a set of rules developers use to determine how to assign a version number to a release. Semantic version follows predictable to inform users of the kind of changes they can expect from one version to the next.

Semantic versioning enforces a pattern of `X.Y.Z` for software version numbers. These values represent **major (X)**, **minor (Y)**, and **patch (Z)** updates.

### Patch changes

Patch changes are the least disruptive changes. They do not change the way you use Astro, and no change to your own code is required when you update.

When Astro issues a "patch" version, the last number increases. (e.g. `astro@4.3.14` -> `astro@4.3.15`)

Patches may be released for reasons such as:

- Re-releases after a failed release.
- Internal changes that do not change Astroâ€™s functionality:
  - refactors
  - performance improvements
  - increase or change in test coverage
  - aligning with stated documentation and expected behavior
- Improvements to logging and error messages.

Patch changes also include bug fixes, even in cases where users were taking advantage of existing unintended or undesirable behavior.


### Minor changes


Minor releases primarily introduce new features and improvements that you may wish to try, but require no changes to your code. Some existing features may also be **deprecated** (marked for deletion in a future version while continuing to function) in a minor release, giving you the opportunity to prepare for their eventual removal.

Minor releases include changes such as:

- **Deprecations** of existing features/options.
- Introduction of new functionalities.
- Upgrade of minimal required Node.js version (minor or patch), e.g. from `v18.4.0` to `v18.7.0`.
  :::note
  We take these kind of changes very seriously, and approve them only if we think that a new version of Node.js can improve the DX of our users, and impact core functionalities.
  :::
- Introduction of new options in the integration hooks.
- Introduction of new functionalities in `astro/app`, notably used for creating new adapters.

A minor release may also include smaller, patch changes at the same time.

### Major changes

Major releases will include breaking changes to at least some existing code. These breaking changes are always documented in an "Upgrade to vX" guide in Astro.

Major releases allow Astro to make significant changes not only to internal logic, but also in intended behavior and usage. Documentation will be updated to reflect the latest version only, and a **static, unmaintained snapshot of older docs** are available as a historical record for older projects that are not yet upgraded.

Major releases include changes such as:

- Upgrade of minimal required Node.js version (minor or major), e.g. from `v18.4.0` to `v20.0.0`.
- Removal of previously deprecated functionalities.
- Changes of existing functionalities.
- Changes of existing options in the integration hooks.
- Changes of existing options and functionalities in `astro/app`, notably used for creating new adapters.

A major release may also include some non-breaking changes and improvements that would normally be released separately in a minor or patch release.

### Exceptions

- **Experimental features** are exempt from semantic versioning. This allows Astro developers the greatest flexibility to explore, and even radically change course, during development. Therefore, the behaviour  of these features can break in minor and patch changes.

  These features are usually accompanied by ongoing, public [Request for Consideration (RFC) stage 3](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap#stage-3-rfc--development). It is expected that beta users will follow for updates, and leave early feedback to help guide development of these features.

  Once these features are out of their experimentation period, they will follow the normal semantic versioning contract.

- **Improvements to the documentation** (e.g. reference and error messages) are also exempt from semantic versioning. This allows Astro to quickly update docs fixes and improvements in the cases where documentation source content is stored in the main `astro` repo.
